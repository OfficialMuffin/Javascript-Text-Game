        Hi, My name is OfficialMuffin!

        <br></br>

        I have been working on a few personal projects that revolve around text based RPG's
        on GitHub. Thery have been coded in C++, C# and various other programming languages. 
        Recently I have tried to start something new and move myself away from basic text RPG's 
        or use another programming language that I have not used before, so I have created this
        short story game in JavaScript.

        <br></br>

        Enjoy :3,
        <br></br>
        OM
